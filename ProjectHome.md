Here is a JQuery quiz plugin which I think will be well suited for many applications. It is bright, simple, and interactive. I wanted to create something that used a lot less javascript for non-programmers to have to enter. It is done in HTML and then the JavaScript is applied to the ID’s & elements. With this, you can use multiple choice or a true false setup, so the options are pretty open. You merely put a “correct” class on the right answer to distinguish it to the javascript, but not to the user.
